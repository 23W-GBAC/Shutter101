## Plovdiv

Plovdiv is Bulgaria’s second-largest city, lying on both sides of the Maritsa River and about two hours from the capital Sofia. The city will take your breath away. It is so lovely and intriguing that you will want to return. This magical city which is built on seven hills, is known as “the city of the hills.”

It has a history of almost 8,000 years, both ancient and timeless.

Plovdiv was already populated in the 11th century B.C. and remains so to this day. It is one of the world’s five oldest cities and the first in Europe. Have we piqued your interest? Many civilizations have occupied Plovdiv, including the Thracians, Romans, and Visconti.

It was taken by the Roman Empire in the first century and became an important hub. Fortresses, public buildings, an antique amphitheatre, a Roman aqueduct, and other structures have been preserved.

## Simbach am Inn

Only a stopover of the Orient Express, today a cross-border middle centre with Braunau am Inn, framed by the nature of the Europareserver Inn reserve.

At the lower reaches of the Inn, nestled between wooded heights in the north and the river course to the south, lies the Lower Bavarian town of Simbach a. Inn. It is the youngest of the three towns in the district of Rottal-Inn and together with the Austrian neighbouring town of Braunau, which is a cross-border middle centre.
The face of Simbach is shaped by Art Nouveau. The carefully renovated town hall from 1910 is a year of life. Many architectural accents are an interesting city center, embedded in greenery. Three bridges – one railway and two road bridges – establish the connection to the Austrian neighbouring town of Braunau.

Beautiful hiking trails lead through the large forests of the northern hilly country. Viewpoints, such as Schellenberg, which is the highest elevation between the Inn and Rott at 549 metres above sea level, opens up attractive views of the Inn Valley and the foothills. The construction of run-of-river power plants created huge reservoirs along the Inn, many kilometres long, through a pristine island world covered with riparian forests. They became the home of numerous water birds, which can only be found in a few areas of Europe today. The bird sanctuary “Beer Inn” was declared a European reserve in 1970.

Also worth seeing in Simbach are the HeimatmuÃ3seum with constantly changing special exhibitions, the Museum Zollhaus – Forum der Moderne and the parish church "Mariä Himmelfahrt" in the district of Erlach.

In Simbach it is very good to live and work. Our guests also feel comfortable with us. Simbach is a lovely and lively small town – cosy, Bavarian, with tradition and history, but also mo down and with a future.

Hi. This is Jayson Dabu a health informatics  student at Technische Hochschule Deggendorf ECRI.
As part of the  requirements in General Business Administration and Accounting. I have two topics
that I would like to evaluate/present: 
- **Providing healthcare access to the very remote areas in the Philippines**
- **Data analysis from monitoring device to provide recommendations to their diet**
But I am more leaning towards my second option. 
    
## Personal Health and Nutrition Tracker

# How it works 
We create a recommender system that provides a person the right and appropriate foods according to health status. This data comes from his/her current data from the monitoring devices, past medical records, existing health condition and his/her preference in foods. But are these datas enough for me to create such system? And that is I still need to figure out. 

# Challenges

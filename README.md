##  :wave: Hello there, I'm **Jayson**.

:school: I'm a first year Health Informatics  student at THD European Campus Rottal-Inn. I have been learning programming languages like Python and R. I have basic understanding with HTML, CSS and Javascript. And looking forward to study data analysis.
 

:books: <p style='text-align: justify'>As part of the requirement in General Business and Accounting. I created this page to discuss the functionality and  objective of my coding project which called **Personalized Health Planner**. Step by step, I will try to figure out what are the necessary tools and information that are required for this project to work out. To answer the question: is this feasible or not? At the end of this semester, I may not be able to provide a full working code for this project, but to be able to  bring a comprehensive explanation about this. But I am looking forward for the following semester, to apply what I will learn and to be able to finish this project and eventually to use it in the real world. One would argue that making this is a waste of time, I know that this kind of project  might already be there running and helping the individuals to improve their lifestyle. I just  want to point out the essence of this blog is to have a clear understanding on how such system is created. This also gives me the opportunity to collaborate with my fellow students to practice what we are learning in our stay in the university.  I believe in this famous quotation "No man is an island", so if you want to give some insights, suggestion or possible solutions. Feel free to leave a meaningful reply.</p> 


#### How  I ended up with this idea?

<p style='text-align: justify'>I want to provide an aid or assistance to an individual whose needing help with their food intake or providing them access towards a healthy lifestyle. And those individuals that does not have an easy access to healthcare. What do I mean with this. I will give an situation where I would like to implement this system. Given a person whose age is X old, let's say around 50s, for this age the chances of  regularly checking their health conditions are high through the use of any  monitoring device like a device to measure  their  blood pressure or bloof sugar level, or base on their  latest blood test result which provide  them information if they have any nutritional deficits, including vitamin defficiency, if they want to stay on fit and healthy, they can use this program to analyze the data and provide them suggestions on what food they need to take, what are to be avoided and  what or whatnot activity or exercises to do to address their problem.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify'>Furthermore, I also want to address some problem from my country (Philippines) for those areas that are isolated or far away from the nearest medical facility and those unprivelage. This could provide them the support that they need as a first access to the healthcare system. This potentially provides them with consistent personalized health recommendations, allowing users to actively monitor their health even when access to healthcare providers is limited. The system allows for remote monitoring of their health data, enabling individuals to track their health status without the need for frequent visits to private healthcare facilities. This could minimizes the need for frequent travel to any healthcare facilities, reducing the burden on individuals living in rural areas, where healthcare services may be geographically distant. Offers educational content that empowers users with information about their health, preventive measures, and self-care, enhancing health literacy in areas where healthcare resources are limited.  We can also make the system that  can be customized to consider local dietary habits, cultural preferences, and environmental factors, making the recommendations more relevant to the specific needs of the community. But it needs allot of collaboration with local healthcare providers, community health workers, and local goverment to ensuring that the system complements existing healthcare infrastructure and addresses the specific needs of the community.</p>

####  What is the goal?

<p style='text-align: justify'>To create a recommender system that provides a person a personalized nutrition and exercise plans based on the person's current health record, food  preferences, and their fitness goals. We can get the data from the  monitoring devices such as blood pressure, blood sugar levels and other health metrics, past medical records, existing health condition, allergies and any restrictions they have, then to be analyze by the system to provide recommendations. The system should also be able to providse customize recommendations to align with local dietary habits, cultural preferences, and environmental factors, ensuring relevance and effectiveness in diverse communities. While we ensure that this given data are secure and safe, and complying with data privacy regulations, such as HIPAA.</p>

#### Who are the target audience?

Aside from the people in remote areas, Here are also the potential target audiences for this project, individuals who are actively interested in managing and improving their health and well-being: 

* <strong>People  with Chronic Conditions</strong> 
  * For people with long-term conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and others who require ongoing monitoring and personal health care. 
* <strong>Fitness Enthusiasts</strong> 
  * Individuals who are health  conscious and they want a customized recommendations for their nutrition, exercise, and overall lifestyle to optimize their fitness goals.
* <strong>Family Monitoring</strong> 
  * Families who want to manage their health together, with features that allow multiple users to track and manage health information.
* <strong>Individuals with Specific Dietary Preferences or Restrictions</strong>
  * Vegetarians, vegans, individuals with food allergies, or those seeking personalized nutritional guidance.
* <strong>Weight Management Seekers</strong> 
  * Those looking to manage their weight, whether it's weight loss, weight gain, or weight maintenance, and looking for a personalized nutrition advice.  
* <strong>Post-Surgical or Post-treatment Patients</strong> 
  * Individuals recovering from surgery or medical procedures who need  personalized healthcare reccomendations during recovery.
* <strong>Preventive Healthcare Advocates</strong>
  * Individuals who prioritize preventive healthcare and want personalized guidance to address potential problems while maintaining good health. 
* <strong>Patients Transitioning from Hospital to Home</strong>
  * Recently discharged individuals who require outpatient care and guidance for a smooth transition to home care.

<p style='text-align: justify'>In addition to this, my fellow students who have also the same interest with me who wants leveraging technology for health monitoring and personalized recommendations. What is the benefits to them? Applying theoretical knowledge gained in our coursework to a real-world project allows us to reinforce the  concepts related to health informatics and data analysis.  To enhance their programming skills by working with technologies and tools used in health informatics, such as data preprocessing, machine learning libraries, and database management. </p>

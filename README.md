#### The Principle Behind Every Pictures

Composing a photograph involves a fundamental concept known as the exposure triangle. The **exposure triangle** is a fundamental concept in photography that explains the relationship between three key elements that determine the exposure of an image: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. Understanding the exposure triangle is crucial for achieving well-exposed and visually appealing photographs.

1. Aperture
	- Aperture refers to the size of the opening in the lens through which light enters the camera.
	- A larger aperture (smaller f-number, e.g., f/2.8) allows more light to enter, resulting in a brighter image. A smaller aperture (larger f-number, e.g., f/16) reduces the amount of light, resulting in a darker image.
	- Aperture also influences the depth of field. A wide aperture (e.g., f/2.8) creates a shallow depth of field, isolating the subject from the background. A narrow aperture (e.g., f/16) increases the depth of field, keeping more of the scene in focus.
2. Shutter Speed
	- Shutter speed refers to the amount of time the camera's shutter remains open, exposing the camera sensor to light.
	- A faster shutter speed (e.g., 1/1000s) allows less light and is suitable for freezing fast-moving subjects. A slower shutter speed (e.g., 1/30s) allows more light and is ideal for capturing motion or in low-light conditions.
	- Shutter speed also affects the perception of motion. Faster shutter speeds freeze action, while slower speeds may introduce intentional motion blur.
3. ISO(Sensitivity to Light)
	- ISO measures the sensitivity of the camera sensor to light.
	- Higher ISO values (e.g., ISO 800, 1600) make the sensor more sensitive to light, resulting in a brighter image. Lower ISO values (e.g., ISO 100, 200) reduce sensitivity, resulting in a darker image.
	- Increasing ISO introduces digital noise, affecting image quality. Therefore, it's essential to find a balance between ISO and other exposure settings.

#### Balancing the Exposure Triangle

1. Achieving the correct exposure involves finding the right combination of aperture, shutter speed, and ISO for a given lighting situation.
2. Adjusting one element may require compensating with the others to maintain a balanced exposure.
3. The exposure triangle allows photographers to creatively control factors such as depth of field, motion blur, and image noise.


Example: 

- For a well-lit scene, you might use a lower ISO (e.g., ISO 100), a moderate aperture (e.g., f/8), and a shutter speed fast enough to avoid camera shake or motion blur.
- In low-light conditions, you may increase ISO, use a wider aperture, or employ a slower shutter speed.

>Mastering the exposure triangle empowers photographers to adapt to various shooting conditions and achieve the desired creative effects in their images.

#### Demystifying Lens Focal Lengths: A Guide to Understanding the Impact of Focal Lengths to Lenses.

The millimeter (mm) measurement in lenses refers to the focal length, which is a crucial factor influencing the lens's field of view, perspective, and overall optical characteristics. Different focal lengths serve distinct purposes in photography, and understanding these differences is essential for choosing the right lens for a specific situation. Here's a brief explanation of the importance of different types of lenses based on their focal lengths:

1. Wide-Angle Lenses (e.g., 16mm - 35mm)
	- Field of View: Wide-angle lenses have a short focal length, providing a broader field of view. They are ideal for capturing expansive scenes and fitting more into the frame.
	- Perspective: Wide-angle lenses exaggerate perspective, making close objects appear larger, and distant objects smaller. This effect is beneficial for emphasizing foreground elements.
	- Use Cases: Commonly used in landscape photography, architectural photography, and situations where capturing a wide view is essential.

2. Normal or Standard Lenses (e.g., 50mm)
	- Field of View: A 50mm lens is often considered a "normal" lens, providing a field of view that is roughly similar to the human eye.
	- Perspective: Normal lenses offer a natural perspective with minimal distortion, making them versatile for various types of photography.
	- Use Cases: Standard lenses are suitable for general-purpose photography, including portraits, street photography, and documentary work.

3. Telephoto Lenses (e.g., 80mm and beyond)
	- Field of View: Telephoto lenses have longer focal lengths, resulting in a narrower field of view. They bring distant subjects closer.
	- Perspective: Telephoto lenses compress perspective, making objects in the frame appear closer together. This is beneficial for isolating subjects and creating a sense of depth.
	- Use Cases: Telephoto lenses are commonly used in wildlife photography, sports photography, and portraiture, where capturing distant or small subjects is important.

4. Zoom Lenses (e.g., 24-70mm, 70-200mm)
	- Versatility: Zoom lenses offer a range of focal lengths within a single lens. For example, a 24-70mm lens allows you to shoot at 24mm for wider shots and zoom in to 70mm for more magnified views.
	- Convenience: Zoom lenses are convenient for situations where changing lenses may not be practical, providing flexibility in composing shots at different focal lengths.
	- Use Cases: Popular for a wide range of photography, including events, travel, and documentary work.

5. Prime Lenses (e.g., 85mm)
	- Versatility: Prime lenses have a fixed focal length, offering a specific field of view. They are valued for their optical quality and larger apertures, allowing for excellent low-light performance and creative depth of field control.
	- Perspective: Prime lenses provide a consistent perspective, often with less distortion than zoom lenses. They are known for delivering sharp images and are popular for portraiture and specific artistic applications.
	- Use Cases: Prime lenses are favored for portrait photography, low-light conditions, and situations where a specific focal length is preferred.

#### File Types: RAW vs JPG

RAW and JPEG are two common file formats used in digital photography, each with distinct characteristics that cater to different needs and preferences. The RAW format, representing the unprocessed data directly captured by the camera's sensor, preserves all the information without any in-camera processing. This results in larger file sizes but provides photographers with unparalleled flexibility in post-processing. RAW files retain a wider dynamic range, allowing for adjustments to exposure, color balance, and other settings without compromising image quality. White balance can be fine-tuned after the photo is taken. However, RAW files demand more storage space and are best suited for advanced users who prioritize maximum control over image editing.

On the other hand, JPEG is a widely used, lossy compression format that undergoes in-camera processing, discarding some image data to reduce file size. This compression makes JPEGs more suitable for storage and sharing, as they are smaller in size and ready-to-share. JPEGs, however, offer limited flexibility in post-processing, and changes to the image can result in a degradation of quality. They have a more limited dynamic range compared to RAW, potentially leading to a loss of detail in highlights and shadows. JPEG is commonly chosen by casual photographers or in situations where storage space is a concern, and the convenience of immediately shareable images is prioritized. The choice between RAW and JPEG often depends on the photographer's workflow, intended use of the images, and preferences regarding post-processing control. Some cameras allow users to shoot in both formats simultaneously, providing a balance between flexibility and convenience.

#### ISSUES

During the creation of this first part of my blog, I would like to point out the repetitive tasks that I did and some problems that I encounter. And let us figure out on how can we automate this tasks. 

~~- First problem is Github page is not design to cater such content where large size of files are used. You can see that most of my images are quite large in size so it takes a while to render this images in Github pages. I need to compress each images.  I am thinking if I could use third party packages which uses CLI. My goal is that every time I add images to certain folder, it will automatically compress the images to the appropriate size or before pushing any images to the repositories we could run a script to compress the images.~~
- Adding description to all of the photos are time consuming, I have to look first for each properties of the images then add it to the description tag. I already have an idea on how to approach this problem. All of my images contains metadata. What does it mean?
	- **Photo metadata** refers to the information embedded within a digital photograph that provides details about the image. This metadata includes various properties and settings related to the creation of the photo. Knowing this, I could extract the metadata of each images and list it down to a JSON file or in a Markdown file. But how could I automatically call out the description of each photos in a JSON or Markdown file. So that I don't need of manually typing it in my README.md?
- Another one is automatic renaming  of every images for easy plugin in the markdown file

### AUTOMATION: IMAGE COMPRESSION. 

#### ISSUE 1

One of the problem that I encounter while rendering my Github page  is the slow loading of my pictures. Given all my pictures are large in size, which I should already expect to happen. I keep all my pictures as high quality as much as possible but in preserving these attributes each images are to be in large file size. I do post-processing in Adobe Lightroom one RAW image is ca 40mb in size after conversion to JPG it will size down to ca. 10-15mb which is stillhigh. I do not want to do again a compression in my Lightroom as I will locate each images  again in my Lightroom library. So I opted to do it in CLI instead, which makes it way more faster. In my photo gallery, my images does not need to be in 100% of their actual resolution  which is 6000x4000. I will resize each images to exactly 600x600 that will result to significantly lower in file size. 

My approach is to use the **direnv**. Why? My photo gallery contains  folder of the places I visited, each folder will only contains 10 photos maximum. It means that once I fulfill the 10 photos to each folder I will not add any more to it. Because of that I will only possibly open the folder once that is why I will use **direnv**.

1. I check if direnv is already pre-installed to my system. Which is not so I will intsall it first. I'm using Manjaro as my distro, I will provide a [link](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) for the other distro like Ubuntu. 

`sudo pamac install direnv`

2. When I tried the direnv in one of my folders nothings happen. After installing you have to hook it to your shell so that it will work. I will only provide the code corresponding to **ZS**H other shell will be different. Add the following line at the end of the `~/.zshrc` file:

`eval "$(direnv hook bash)"`

3. After that I will run `direnv allow` to each of my folder ensuring that I already  have **.envrc** withouth this you will receive an error message in the terminal. 

>direnv: error .envrc file not found

4. I will create **.envrc** file which I will copy to each of my folder. So every time I will create additional directory for my photo gallery I will copy this .envrc. Something like this:

```
mkdir Gallery1
cp ~/jysndabu/.envrc ~/jysndabu/photos/Gallery1
```

My .envrc contains shell scripting that resize every images in the folder while keeping a record to the images that will be processed so that the script  will not repeat the resizing of all images if I added new photos or if I enter the directory again. It will only resize untrack photos. This will  not replace my original photos  but to create a resized copy of each which will be loacted to the specific folder called "img". To this we have to create a loop which check all imgaes in the folder if certain condition are met then it will perform certain tasks. 

In this script I use [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) to resize images  and grep for searching the images in the list. 

>*First we  have to create a directory called "img" for all  the resized images.*

`mkdir img`

>*After that  we have also need to create a container to append every images name that will be processed.*

`touch resized_images_list.md`

>*Then  we use "for" loop to access each images in the directory where the .envrc is located. I include all possible formats for images.*

`for file in *.jpg *.jpeg *.png *.gif *.JPG *.JPEG; do` 

>*We have to store the name of the image in a variable. Basename is used to provide only the file name and extension, if we removed this we will get the full path of the image.*

`filename=$(basename "$file")`

>*To check if the image is in the list of resized images, we use grep. -q to to silence it. *

`if ! grep -q "$filename" "resized_images_list.md"; then`

>*If it return TRUE then we resize the image by using imagemagick.* 

`convert "$file" -resize "600x600>" "img/$filename"`

>*convert is the command for imagemagick then followed by the image to be resized + the process to be done to the image which is resize indicating also the the dimensions + where to save and the filename.* 
>*After that we append the name of the image to our container.*

`echo "$filename" >> "$resized_images_li"`

>*We end the condition by:*

`fi`

`done`

But after several tries, I realized that every time I enter in the directory it will try to create again  the directory "img" and the resized_images_list.md, which should not be because it was already created at the first time it run the script. So I think it is better to check first if the directory "img" and resized_images_list.md file is laready there. We use "if statement"  again for this.

```
if ! -d "img"; then
	mkdir img
else
	echo "The directory is already exists. Skipping write directory."
fi

if ! -f "resized_images_list.md";then
	touch resized_images_list_.md"
else
	echo "The file is already exists. Skipping file creation."
fi
```

It did work but I still received an error message in the terminal like this every time I try to enter in the directory;

>./.envrc:4: -d: command not found
>
>mkdir: cannot create directory ‘img’: File exists
>
>./.envrc:10: -f: command not found
 
My full script will look like this:

```
#!/bin/bash

if ! -d "img"; then 
	mkdir img
else 
	echo "The directory is already exists. Skipping write directory."
fi 

if ! -f "resized_images_list.md"; then 
	touch resized_images_list.md
else
	echo "The file is already exists. Skipping file creation."
fi 

for file in *.jpg *.jpeg *.png *.gif *.JPG *.JPEG; do
	filename=$(basename "$file")

	if ! grep -q "$filename" "resized_images_list.md"; then
		convert "$file" -resize "600x600>" "img/$filename"

		echo "$filename" >> resized_images_list.md
	fi
done
```

### TASKS FOR WEEK 3
- [ ] Tasks from Week 1
- [ ] To automate the creation of my gallery container each location like in Phil.md, Simbach.md, Heidelburg.md so everytime I add new collection it will self generate this markdown file.
